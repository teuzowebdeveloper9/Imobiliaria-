# Imobiliaria-

While developing this simple project using SQL, PHP, and HTML, my main goal was to test my knowledge, especially with SQL databases. I had worked with this technology before, but I felt the need to practice more to avoid getting rusty.

Throughout the process, I reinforced essential concepts, from database modeling to executing more complex queries, while also integrating everything with PHP and HTML to create a functional application. It was a valuable experience and a great exercise to keep my skills sharp.

Thank you to everyone who took the time to read and follow this project!
